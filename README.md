## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) - This is JS library for scrolling animation


### What I learned

This project helped me to learn how much time it takes for me to build this type of websites. 

### Continued development

I need to improve my project building skills. Cause I had a target of building this project within a day. 

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll) - I used this lightweight script to add smooth scrolling to the page. So, when navigation link is clicked the page will scroll smoothly.
